<!-- A constructor is a function that creates and initializes an object. JavaScript provides a special
    constructor function called Object() to build the object. The return value of the Object()
    constructor is assigned to a variable.
The variable contains a reference to the new object. The properties assigned to the object are not
    variables and are not defined with the var keyword. -->
