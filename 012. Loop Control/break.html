<!-- The break statement, which was briefly introduced with the switch statement, is
used to exit a loop early, breaking out of the enclosing curly braces.

The following example illustrates the use of a break statement with a while
loop. Notice how the loop breaks out early once x reaches 5 and reaches to
document.write (..) statement just below to the closing curly brace: 
-->

<html>
    <body>
        <script>
            var x = 1
            document.write("Entering the loop<br>")
            while(x < 20) {
                if (x == 5) {
                    break   //breaks out of loop completely
                }
                x = x + 1
                document.write(x + "<br>")
            }
            document.write("Exiting the loop!<br>")
        </script>
    </body>
