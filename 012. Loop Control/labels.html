<!-- a label can be used with break and continue to control the flow more precisely. 
    A label is simply an identifier followed by a colon (:) that is applied to a statement 
    or a block of code.
Note: Line breaks are not allowed between the ‘continue’ or ‘break’ statement and its label name. 
Also, there should not be any other statement in between a label name and associated loop.
