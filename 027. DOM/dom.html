<!-- 
Every web page resides inside a browser window which can be considered as an object.
A Document object represents the HTML document that is displayed in that window. The Document object 
has various properties that refer to other objects which allow access to and modification of document 
content. The way a document content is accessed and modified is called the Document Object Model, or DOM.
The Objects are organized in a hierarchy. This hierarchical structure applies to the organization of 
    objects in a Web document.
-->

<!-- We can locate any HTML element within any HTML document using HTML DOM. 
For instance, if a web document contains a form element, then using JavaScript, 
we can refer to it as document.forms[0]. If your Web document includes two
form elements, the first form is referred to as document.forms[0] and the
second as document.forms[1].
Using the hierarchy and properties given above, we can access the first form
element using document.forms[0].elements[0] and so on. -->
