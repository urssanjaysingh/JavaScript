<!-- This method splits a String object into an array of strings by separating the
string into substrings.

Its syntax is as follows:
    string.split([separator][, limit]);
Argument Details
>> separator : Specifies the character to use for separating the string. If separator is omitted, 
                the array returned contains one element consisting of the entire string.
>> limit : Integer specifying a limit on the number of splits to be found.

The split method returns the new array. Also, when the string is empty, split returns an array 
containing one empty string, rather than an empty array. -->
