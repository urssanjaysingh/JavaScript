<!-- This method extracts a section of a string and returns a new string.

The syntax for slice() method is: 
    string.slice( beginslice [, endSlice] );

>> beginSlice : The zero-based index at which to begin extraction.
>> endSlice : The zero-based index at which to end extraction. 
                If omitted, slice extracts to the end of the string.
            
If successful, slice returns the index of the regular expression inside the string. 
Otherwise, it returns -1.-->
