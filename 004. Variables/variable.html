<!-- JavaScript allow you to three primitive data types: >> Numbers, String and Boolean
JavaScript also defines two trivial data types, null and undefined, each of which defines 
only a single value. In addition to these primitive data types, mJavaScript supports a composite 
data type known as object.

Note: Java does not make a distinction between integer values and floatingpoint values. All numbers 
in JavaScript are represented as floating-point values. Before you use a variable in a JavaScript program, you must declare it. Variables are declared with the var keyword. -->

    <head>
        <script>
            var x = 10;
            var y = 20;
            var z = x + y;
            document.write(z);  
        </script>
    </head>

<!-- Note: Use the var keyword only for declaration or initialization, once for the life of any 
    variable name in a document. You should not re-declare same variable twice. -->
