<!-- The â€˜forâ€™ loop is the most compact form of looping. It includes the following three important parts:

>> The loop initialization where we initialize our counter to a starting value. 
    The initialization statement is executed before the loop begins.

>> The test statement which will test if a given condition is true or not. 
    If the condition is true, then the code given inside the loop will be executed, 
    otherwise the control will come out of the loop.

>> The iteration statement where you can increase or decrease your counter.

You can put all the three parts in a single line separated by semicolons.

The syntax of for loop is JavaScript is as follows:

    for (initialization; test condition; iteration statement){
    Statement(s) to be executed if test condition is true
    }
