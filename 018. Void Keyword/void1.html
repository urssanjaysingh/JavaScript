<!-- void is an important keyword in JavaScript which can be used as a unary
operator that appears before its single operand, which may be of any type. This
operator specifies an expression to be evaluated without returning a value. -->

<!-- The most common use of this operator is in a client-side javascript: URL, where
it allows you to evaluate an expression for its side-effects without the browser
displaying the value of the evaluated expression.
Here the expression alert ('Warning!!!') is evaluated but it is not loaded back
into the current document: -->

<html>
    <head>
        <script>
        </script>
    </head>

    <body>
        <p>Click the follwing, This won't react at all...</p>
        <a href="javascript:void(document.write("Hello : 0"))">Click Me!</a>
    </body>
</html>
