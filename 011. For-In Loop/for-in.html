<!-- The for-in loop is used to loop through an object's properties. 
    As we have not discussed Objects yet, you may not fee comfortable with this loop. 
    But once you understand how objects behave in JavaScript, you will find this loop very useful.
The syntax of ‘for..in’ loop is:
    for (variablename in object){
    statement or block to execute
    }
In each iteration, one property from object is assigned to variablename and this loop continues till 
    all the properties of the object are exhausted. -->

<!-- 
Try the following example to implement ‘for-in’ loop. It prints the web browser’s Navigator object. 
-->

<html>
    <body>
        <script>
            var aProperty;
            document.write("Navigator Object Properties:<br><br>")
            for(aProperty in navigator) {
                document.write(aProperty)
                document.write("<br>")
            }
        </script>
    </body>
</html>
