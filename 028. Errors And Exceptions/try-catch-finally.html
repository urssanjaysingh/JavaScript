<!-- The latest versions of JavaScript added exception handling capabilities.
JavaScript implements the try...catch...finally construct as well as
the throw operator to handle exceptions.
You can catch programmer-generated and runtime exceptions, but you cannot
catch JavaScript syntax errors. -->
