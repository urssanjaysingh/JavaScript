<!-- Javascript array splice() method changes the content of an array, adding new elements while 
    removing old elements.

Its syntax is as follows:
    array.splice(index, howMany, [element1][, ..., elementN]);

>> index: Index at which to start changing the array.
>> howMany: An integer indicating the number of old array elements to remove. 
            If howMany is 0, no elements are removed.
>> element1, ..., elementN: The elements to add to the array. If you don't specify any elements, 
                            splice simply removes the elements from the array. -->
