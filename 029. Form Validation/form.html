<!-- Form validation normally used to occur at the server, after the client had
entered all the necessary data and then pressed the Submit button. If the data
entered by a client was incorrect or was simply missing, the server would have
to send all the data back to the client and request that the form be resubmitted
with correct information. This was really a lengthy process which used to put a
lot of burden on the server. -->
