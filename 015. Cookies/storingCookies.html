<!-- The simplest way to create a cookie is to assign a string value to the document.cookie object, 
    which looks like this.
        document.cookie = "key1=value1;key2=value2;expires=date";
Here the expires attribute is optional. If you provide this attribute with a valid date or time, then 
the cookie will expire on a given date or time and thereafter, the cookies' value will not be accessible.

Note: Cookie values may not include semicolons, commas, or whitespace. For this reason, 
you may want to use the JavaScript escape() function to encode the value before storing it in the cookie.
If you do this, you will also have to use the corresponding unescape() function when you read the cookie value. -->

            function WriteCookie() {
                if(document.myform.customer.value == "") {
                    alert("Enter some value!")
                    return
                }

                cookievalue = escape(document.myform.customer.value) + ";"
                document.cookie = "name" + cookievalue
                document.write("Setting Cookies : " + "name = " + cookievalue)

<!-- Now your machine has a cookie called name. You can set multiple cookies using
multiple key=value pairs separated by comma. -->
