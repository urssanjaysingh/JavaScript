<!-- The funtion statement is not the only way to define a new function;
you can define your function dynamically using Function() constructor along with the new operator.

NOTE: Constructor is a terminology from Object Oriented Programming. You may not feel confortable for 
the first time, which is OK. 

Following is the syntax to create a function using Function() constructor along with the new operator.

        var variablename = new Function(Arg1, Arg2..., "Function Body");

The Function() constructor expects any number of string arguments. The last argument is the body of 
the function â€“ it can contain arbitrary JavaScript statements, separated from each other by semicolons.
Notice that the Function() constructor is not passed any argument that specifies a name for the function
it creates. The unnamed functions created with the Function() constructor are called anonymous functions.
