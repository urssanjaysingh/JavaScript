<!-- Before we use a function, we need to define it. The most common way to define a function in 
    JavaScript is by using the function keyword, followed by a unique function name, a list of 
    parameters (that might be empty), and a statement block surrounded by curly braces. 
Try the following example. It defines a function called sayHello that takes no parameters:
To invoke a function somewhere later in the script, you would simply need to write the name of that 
function as shown in the following code.
-->

<html>
    <head>
        <script>
            function sayHello() {
                document.write("Hello!")
            }
        </script>
    </head>

    <body>
        <p>Click the following button to call the function</p>
        <form>
            <input type="button" onclick="sayHello()" value="Say Hello">
        </form>
    </body>
</html>
