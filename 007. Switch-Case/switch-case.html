<!-- The objective of a switch statement is to give an expression to evaluate and several different
    statements to execute based on the value of the expression. The interpreter checks each case 
    against the value of the expression until a match is found. If nothing matches, a default condition
    will be used. 
The break statements indicate the end of a particular case. If they were omitted, the interpreter 
would continue executing each statement in each of the following cases. -->
