<!-- You can show an appropriate message to your site visitors before redirecting them to a new page. 
This would need a bit time delay to load a new page. 
The following example shows how to implement the same. Here setTimeout() is a built-in JavaScript
function which can be used to execute another function after a given time interval. -->

<html>
    <head>
        <script>
            function Redirect() {
                window.location = "http://www.google.co.in"
            }
            document.write("You will be redirected to Google search in 10 seconds!")
            setTimeout('Redirect()', 10000)
        </script>
    </head>
</html>
