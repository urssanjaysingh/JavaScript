<!-- Let's take a sample example to print out "Hello World." 
We added an optional HTML comment that surrounds our JavaScript code. This is to save our code 
from a browser that does not support JavaScript. The comment ends with a "//-- >". 
Here "//" signifies a comment in JavaScript, so we add that to prevent a browser from reading 
the end of the HTML comment as a piece of JavaScript code. 
Next, we call a function document.write which writes a string into our HTML document. -->

<html>
    <body>
        <script lang="javascript" type="text/javascript">
            <!--
                document.write("Hello World!")
            -->
        </script>
    </body>
</html>

NOTE: 
>> JavaScript ignores whitespace and newlines that appear in JavaScript programs. 
>> Semicolons(;) are Optional in JavaScript if each of your statements are placed on a separate line.
But When formatted in a single line as follows, you must use semicolons:
            var1 = 10; var2 = 20;
>> JavaScript is a case-sensitive language.
