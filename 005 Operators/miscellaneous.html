<!-- We will discuss two operators here that are quite useful in JavaScript: the conditional operator(?:) and the typeof operators. -->

<!-- Conditional Operator(?:)
The conditional operator first evaluates an expression for a true or false value and then one of the 
two given statements depending upon the result of the evaluation.
    ?: (Condition)
    If Conditiona is true? Then value X : Othervise value Y
-->

<!-- typeof Operator:
The typeof operator is a unary operator that is placed before its single operand, which can be of 
any type. Its value is a string indicating the data type of the operand. -->
